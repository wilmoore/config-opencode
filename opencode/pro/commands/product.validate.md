## Context

Let's validate: $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose

Run comprehensive, brutal market validation against a product idea. This command acts like a harsh technical co-founder who will:

- **Destroy weak ideas** - Surface every flaw, risk, and reason it won't work
- **Confirm strong ideas** - If it survives the gauntlet, you know it's real
- **Be direct, not cruel** - Honest feedback to help you succeed, not discourage you

**This is not a cheerleader.** This is the co-founder who saves you from wasting years on a doomed idea.

## Your Task

**ultrathink:** This market validation requires deep, multi-dimensional analysis. Before researching, consider the idea's core thesis, potential failure modes, and what evidence would truly validate or invalidate it. Think through competitive dynamics, timing factors, and buyer psychology systematically.

### Step 1: Resolve Input

Find the product brief in this order:
1. If `$ARGUMENTS` is a file path: read it
2. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains brief content: use it
3. If no arguments: find the most recent brief
   - Check for `doc/.plan/product/briefs/*.md` files
   - If found: use the most recent (by filename date)
   - If empty: check for legacy `doc/.plan/product/brief.md` (non-index format)
4. If still not found: error with helpful message

```
Error: No product brief found.

Run `/pro:product.brief` first to create a brief, or pass your idea as an argument.
```

### Step 2: Extract Core Thesis

From the brief, identify:
- **Problem claim:** What pain are they claiming exists?
- **Solution claim:** How they claim to solve it?
- **Customer claim:** Who they claim will pay?
- **Timing claim:** Why they claim now is the right time?

These become the hypotheses to validate or invalidate.

### Step 3: Deep Research

Use `WebSearch` to research each dimension. Run multiple searches:

**Market Signal Research:**
- "[problem] complaints" OR "[problem] frustration"
- "[solution category] reviews" OR "[solution type] problems"
- "[target customer] pain points [year]"

**Competitive Research:**
- "[solution type] competitors"
- "[problem] solutions [year]"
- "alternatives to [existing solutions]"

**Timing Research:**
- "[industry] trends [year]"
- "[problem space] market size"
- "[relevant technology/policy] impact"

**Buyer Research:**
- "[target customer] spending on [category]"
- "[problem] willingness to pay"
- "[solution category] pricing"

### Step 4: Synthesize Findings

Compile research into a brutal, honest assessment:

#### Signal Strength Assessment
Rate evidence for each dimension:
- **Extremely High:** Multiple strong signals, quantified demand
- **High:** Clear signals, some quantification
- **Medium:** Mixed signals, anecdotal evidence
- **Low:** Weak signals, mostly speculation
- **None:** No evidence found

### Step 5: Generate Validation Report

Create the report with this structure:

```markdown
# Market Validation Report

**Idea:** [one-line summary]
**Validated:** [ISO 8601 timestamp]
**Verdict:** [GO / CAUTION / NO-GO]

---

---

*Validated by /pro:product.validate*
*[timestamp]*
```

### Step 6: Write Report to File

```
## Validation Complete

**VERDICT: [GO / CAUTION / NO-GO]**

**Overall Score:** X/10

### [Key Findings - adapt based on verdict]

Saved to: `doc/.plan/product/validation-2026-01-01-220000.md`
Copied to clipboard.

**Next step:** [Based on verdict - either "Run /pro:product.pitch" or "Reconsider these issues:"]
```

## The Harsh Persona

Write in the voice of a brutal but fair technical co-founder:

### DO:
- Be direct. "This won't work because..." not "There might be some challenges..."
- Use evidence. Every claim backed by research.
- Be specific. "The market is $2B" not "The market is big"
- Acknowledge strengths. If something is strong, say so clearly.
- Point to fixes. "This fails unless you..." is better than just "This fails."

### DON'T:
- Hedge. No "it depends" without explanation.
- Be vague. No "there are some concerns."
- Be cruel. Goal is to help, not discourage.
- Sugarcoat. Don't bury the bad news.

### Example Tone:

**Strong idea:**
> "The market is screaming for this. You're not inventing demand - you're organizing chaos. That's a strong position. The risk is execution, not validation."

**Weak idea:**
> "There's no evidence anyone will pay for this. The 'problem' you're solving is a minor inconvenience, not a hair-on-fire pain point. Either find a more painful angle or kill this idea."

**Mixed:**
> "The pain is real, but your solution is undifferentiated. Three well-funded competitors already do this. You need a wedge - a specific segment they're ignoring - or this is a losing battle."

## Research API Extension (Future)

If `doc/.plan/product/config.json` exists with additional APIs configured, use them:

```json
{
  "research": {
    "sources": ["websearch", "perplexity"],
    "perplexity": {
      "enabled": true,
      "apiKey": "${PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}"
    }
  }
}
```

For v1, use WebSearch only. Extension hooks are designed for future integration.

## Non-Git Directory Support

Works in any directory without git:
- Creates `doc/.plan/product/` if needed
- No git operations required
- Designed for pre-repo idea validation

## Definition of Done

- Brief resolved (from argument, file, `doc/.plan/product/briefs/*.md`, or legacy `brief.md`)
- Core thesis extracted
- Multi-dimensional research completed
- Evidence synthesized
- Brutal validation report generated
- Report written with timestamp
- Report copied to clipboard
- Summary displayed with verdict and next steps
